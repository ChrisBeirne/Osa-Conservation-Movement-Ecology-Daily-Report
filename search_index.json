This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48-72 hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event 3.0.1 Costa Rica The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): 3.0.2 Peru The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night.
